"""Word/phoneme alignment for singing faces — session-friendly wrapper.

Runs :class:`src.analyzer.phonemes.PhonemeAnalyzer` (WhisperX forced
alignment + cmudict decomposition) and returns plain mark dicts ready to
persist in an X-Onset session (``words`` / ``phonemes`` keys) and to embed
as .xsq timing tracks.

WhisperX may live in the main venv (Windows host) or in the ``.venv-vamp``
sidecar (devcontainer). This module tries an in-process run first and falls
back to a sidecar subprocess — the same pattern as
``src.story.builder._try_free_transcription``.

    Each word mark is ``{"label": str, "start_ms": int, "end_ms": int,

    (lead) or 1 (featured/backup), from :func:`diarize_words
    <src.analyzer.vocal_diarization.diarize_words>` — always 0 when no
    second voice is confidently detected. Phoneme labels are Papagayo mouth
    shapes (AI/E/O/U/WQ/L/MBP/FV/etc/rest) matching xLights face
    definitions.

    When ``lyric_lines`` (session ``lyrics`` — ``{t_ms, duration_ms,
    text}``, i.e. real LRC timestamps) is provided, WhisperX force-aligns
    that known lyric text. Otherwise, when ``lyrics_text`` (raw plain text —
    e.g. a user-pasted lyrics fallback, or an untimed provider result) is
    provided, WhisperX force-aligns THAT instead. Both produce far more
    accurate word text than free transcription, which only guesses words
    from audio alone (user-confirmed 2026-07-21: free transcription on a
    pasted-but-untimed song produced garbage words). Only when NEITHER is
    available does it fall back to free transcription. Prefers the cached
    demucs vocals stem over the full mix when one exists.

    ``warnings`` includes, notably, the case where lyric text was provided
    but fewer than 50% of its words aligned to the audio — the analyzer
    discards the provided text entirely and falls back to free
    transcription for the WHOLE song in that case (see
    ``PhonemeAnalyzer._align_with_lyrics``), so the returned words can look
    like "made up" text even though real lyrics were supplied. Surface this
    warning to the user rather than silently returning different words than
    what they pasted.

    Never raises: returns ``([], [], [])`` when WhisperX is unavailable in
    both the main venv and the ``.venv-vamp`` sidecar, or when alignment
    fails.
